# RoomAggregatorAPI Eclipse Java project

This folder is the root directory of an Eclipse Java project that contains classes to automatically update the number of 
available seats stored in the SIB for a monitored study room. The RoomAggregatorAPI.jar is already available in build/libs.

If you want to build the project yourself, run "./gradlew eclipse" first and then "./gradlew build" in the root directory of
the project.
